# This file contains code that generates the synthetic experiment described on the paper.
#
# The following experiments want to be show:
#  - The presented probability ratio is suitable for novelty detection,
#  - Approximating the unconditional probability improves detection performance.
#  - Measure effect of approximating unconditional probability as the available information increases.
