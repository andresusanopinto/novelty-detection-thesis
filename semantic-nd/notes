Title:
  Semantic Novelty Detection on Dora
  Semantic Novelty Detection with Graphical Models

Contents:
  Explain how Dora deals with information and uses a probabilistic
  knowledge representation to reasoning and perform spatial understanding.

  Explain which types of properties are extracted and how room are categorized.

  Explain traditional approach to novelty detection using conditional probability density.
  Point to the fact large databases exists on the web and ability to draw unconditional
  probabilities.

  Explain we need a normalizing factor to be able to use that as a threshold.

  Show improvements in using P(x|k)/P(x) instead of only P(x).
