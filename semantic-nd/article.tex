\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an approach to the problem of novelty
detection in the context of semantic room categorization.
The ability to assign semantic labels to areas in the environment is crucial for
autonomous agents aiming to perform complex human-like tasks and human
interaction.
However, in order to be robust and naturally learn the semantics from
the human user, the agent must be able to identify gaps in its own knowledge.
To this end, we propose a method based on graphical models to identify novel
input which does not match any of the previously learnt semantic descriptions.
The method employs a novelty threshold defined in terms of conditional
and unconditional probabilities. The novelty threshold is then optimized using
an unconditional probability density model trained from unlabelled data.

\section{Introduction}
There has been several efforts in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
in creating robots that are able to interact with humans and their environments.
One of the existing problems is a reliable high-level localization method that can
be deployed into new and unknown environments or where its impossible to access a
previously labelled map of the area. Nonetheless the need of reliability and ability
to deal with new cases also arises due to dynamic changes on the environment through
time and with human action.
This article focus on the mapping, using \emph{semantic data}, of indoor
environments such as houses and offices to room categories such as kitchen,
corridor, office.

Due to the unknown and dynamic nature of the operating environment the
mapping methods should be resilient to new room categories the agent has never seen
before. This is: perform novelty detection on the concepts the agent is aware of.

Dora\cite{dora} (CogX: Dora) was used as a base system where to implement the
presented novelty detection system as it already possesses a developed architecture
oriented on dealing with probabilistic and semantic information and performing
reasoning over it.
Implementing novelty detection capabilities on an agent such as Dora, would allow to
to increase reliability and allow the creation of self-extending behaviours.

Its with a final interest on integrating the developed methods on Dora that this
initial work focus on the novelty detection using probabilistic graphical models
that model the conceptual knowledge and information handled by Dora.

\section{Related Work}
The usage of multi-modal approaches, such as combining semantic data extracted from
several sources or classifiers is expected to have better performance on scene
recognition than single approaches according to \cite{quattoni2009recognizing}
that showed that most scene recognition models work poorly in indoor scenes when
compared to outdoor scenes results since the properties that
characterize rooms changes conforming its category. Namely corridors are well
described by global properties and bookstores are well described by the presence of
specific objects (books).
\cite{galindo2005multi} also exploits this by defining a bidirectional relation
between object and room category, where object defines a room category and a room
category provides information on where objects may be found.

Probabilistic representations have also been used in several localised functions
in robots operating in the real-world~\cite{gross2009toomas,maierprobabilistic}.
And some employ, up to some extent, a probabilistic representation across some
subsystems~\cite{kraft2008exploration}.
And \cite{boutell2006factor} have studied outdoor scene classification using
\emph{factor graphs} and modelling spatial relations between objects in the scene
to extract better knowledge from semantic (high-level) features.

Also although this paper deals with robotics area, it does so
using standard concepts and techniques such as semantic data and graphical models.
Those are often found on areas related with information retrieval.
An interesting example is the work in automatic image annotation using an hidden
concept layer between visual features and text information by \cite{zhang2005probabilistic}.

Novelty detection has been studied for some years and there is several approaches
based on statistical analysis as reported by \cite{markou2003novelty}.
Graphical models have been used to learn distributions of variables, both in
supervised and unsupervised ways and by using thresholds on those distributions
based solely on the conditional probability as seen on \cite{bishop1994novelty}
a novelty system can be trivially implemented.
But as far as we known there is no reference on how to perform novelty detection
by using graphs that are dynamically generated.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Dora Architecture Overview}
Short paragraph describing dora. Short paragraph describing dora. Short paragraph describing dora. Short paragraph describing dora. Short paragraph describing dora.

As Dora moves through the environment its \emph{conceptual layer} builds a structural and
probabilistic representation of the space instantiated as a \emph{graphical model}.
That model connects the sensed properties together with the variables used to model the world.
And allows to perform queries on the probabilities of aspects of the environment.
For example: where is most likely to find a cereal box\cite{exploiting}.

From its architecture only the \emph{conceptual layer} is of interest to this article.
Its role is to aggregate the following semantic information coming from other layers:

\begin{description}
 \item[Doorway detection] is used to segment the low-level space into rooms and map connectivity between them.
 \item[Room size and shape] are classified by using 2D laser scans data and are associated as properties of a given room. The system utilizes pre-trained set of classifiers to label size as (large, medium, small) and shape as (rectangular or elongated).
 \item[Object detection] is performed using the visual input in order to detect . The system keeps track of the number of object and types seen per each room. Objects are once again detected by running a pre-trained set of detectors for: book, cereal box, computer, robot, stapler, toilet paper.
 \item[Room appearance] is categorized from the visual input by using CRFH and a pre-trained set of 7 different models.
\end{description}

With the extracted information and conceptual knowledge the conceptual layer creates a structured probabilistic representation
in order to model all known variables and their relations.
As so, in order to represent the knowledge the layer builds a \emph{chain graph}:
a probabilistic graphical model that merges both Bayesian Networks and Random Markov Fields.

The use of graphical models to describe distributions of variables has useful properties.
The edges between the variables can be seen as a kind of filter to the properties of the system.
Properties those that are expected to be captured by the conceptual knowledge.
At the same time they are a generative models and therefore allow to calculate the probability
on any given subset of variables on the graph allowing the system to work even when some
information is missing.

\caption{The conceptual layer structures the sensed environment together with the conceptual knowledge
         in order to create a structured probabilistic representation of the world.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Factor Graphs}
Although the conceptual layer works with \emph{chain graphs}, those can be converted
into \emph{factor graphs}. Those are used through this paper as they provide an
easier manipulation in terms of factorization.

A \emph{factor graph} is a bipartite graph connecting a set of nodes representing
random variables and factors.
Each factor represents a function dependent only on the variables to where its connected.
As so given factor graph can be seen as description of a distribution function over a set
of variables obtained by the product of all the factors. In order to represent a probability
a normalization factor needs to be introduced:

\begin{equation}
P_G(x) = \frac{1}{Z}\prod_{\phi \in F_G}{\phi(x_{\phi})},\qquad
Z = \sum_{x \in X_G}\prod_{\phi \in F_G}{\phi(x_{\phi})}
\end{equation}

Describing the distribution function in terms of graphs allows to use algorithms
such as the Sum-Product~\citep{kschischang2001factor} to efficiently calculate
marginals on any given subset $x_m$ of variables by exploiting conditional
independence between variables.

\section{Novelty Detection}
% Introduce novelty detection
Novelty detection deals with detecting that a new input was generated by a class
other than the ones the system knows about \citep{markou2003novelty}.
It is harder than classification as only positive samples of a class are available
rendering normal classification methods invalid.

% Explain threshold approach to novelty detection
Due to the desire of robustness and generalization, a novelty detection system would
always possess some threshold that describes on how strict the system should be to
new data.
This threshold describes a trade between error and rejection.
And is often seen as a distance measure to the known class.

When dealing with a statistic point of view, noisy data or unstable features, a decision on a
given input has an associated error rate. A novelty detection system is interested in defining an
order on all the possible inputs equivalent to the order imposed by the error rate: $P(novel|x)$.

Using bayes rule on the reversed order $P(\overline{novel}|x)$ and assuming a constant $P(\overline{novel})$
a ratio between a conditional and unconditional probabilities of the input $x$ is obtained.
Such a ratio is a suitable function for implementing an optimal novelty detector system with
thresholding.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:novelty-threshold}
          P(\overline{novel}|x)
  =       \frac{P(x|\overline{novel}) P(\overline{novel})}{P(x)}
  \propto \frac{P(x|\overline{novel})}{P(x)}
\end{equation}

% Explain approach of using conditional probability
\subsection{Conditional Probability}
\label{sec:conditional-prob}


In the presented case the conditional probability is approximated by the graphical model $G$
produced by the conceptual layer.
\autoref{fig:conditional-prob-graph} represents a possible graph $G$ built from the conceptual
layer to represent the conditional probability on the sensed variables $x$.
$P_G(x)$ is used as an approximation for $P(x|\overline{novel})$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/conditional-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:conditional-prob-graph}The conceptual layer models the conditional
         probability distribution of the sensed variables by using hidden variables.
         Those are created from the conceptual knowledge and represent the structural
         and connectivity information the system is aware of.
         In this case only hidden variables $R_i$ were used to model the room categories
         where each property was sensed.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Unconditional Probability}
\label{sec:unconditional-prob}
One of the hardest problems is that on most cases a novelty detection system only
has access to the known data.
Under that the best approach is to define a threshold assuming that $P(x)$ is
constant through all the input space.

Its important to notice that in several cases assuming it to be constant leads to
discarding the factor.
Nonetheless, here the distributions are dynamically changing as the system learns
more on the environment.
So the normalizing argument $P(x)$ has to be evaluated for each new subset of $x$.

Assuming that the unconditional distributions generates all possible outcome with
the same probability we can model it with $\prod{1/\# x_i}$,
where $\# x_i$ denotes the cardinality of the state space of variable $x_i$.
In graphical model terms this is represented to a factor graph $U$ with the
variables but without any factors as illustrated on \autoref{fig:uniform-prob-graph}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/uniform-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:uniform-prob-graph}Without any existing factors, this graph $U$ represents a
         uniform distribution over any set of its variables.}
\end{figure}

Having a graphical model $G$ built to model the known data distribution and a model
$U$ for the unconditional probability a novelty threshold would be given by:
$P_G(x)/P_U(x)$.
Here $P_{U}(x)$ can be seen as a normalizing factor to lever all the $P_G(x)$ on any set of
variables $x$ into the same measure units (error rate), such that a static threshold can be implemented.
For example the conditional probability would yield very small values on large sets of variables
$x$ than in small sets due to the spreading over the dimensions of the input space.
As so a novelty measure is seen as a ratio on how much introducing the known concepts helps to
understand the observed result.


\subsection{Semi Supervised: Using Unlabelled Data}
Nonetheless its often the case that there is access to large amounts of unlabelled data.
Under that it becomes possible to obtain a better approach to the unconditional probability
distribution than the uniform one.

For interesting and practical reasons it was assumed that the unconditional distribution
could be modelled with all the variables independent from each other.
Which translates as $P(x)=\prod{P_{x_i}(x_i)}$.
From the unlabelled data only the probability of each feature $x_i$ needs to be estimated.
\autoref{fig:semisupervised-threshold} illustrates a graph $I$ to model independent variables.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/independent-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:semisupervised-threshold}Using unlabelled data, its possible to estimate
         the unconditional probability for each variable and this way try to compensate
         for a possible existent bias on some of the variables.}
\end{figure}

Once again the novelty threshold would be given by $P_G(x)/P_I(x)$.
This time the addition of the variables unconditional factors can be understood as an
attempt to compensate for an existing bias on the unconditional distribution.
Which is an important step to achieve a correct ordering of the input space for novelty
thresholding.

\section{Results}
In order to verify the performance of the proposed thresholds a synthetic dataset
was generated. To keep it simple only information regarding direct properties of
a room were modelled and no structured knowledge such as room connectivity was taken
in account.
The synthetic distribution assumes that an independent and variable size set of features
$x$ is generated by a given room category.
In whole there was 11 different room categories and 7 different measured feature
types. Each feature type can be present more than once in (Eg.: room shape is
extracted from 2D laser scans in more than one position in the room).

The room categories were chosen to mimic as close as possible real features and
categories existent on reality. And they model different room categories with
different levels of detail. For example: 1 person office, 2 person office, hallway,
robot lab.

From the distribution, 100 labelled samples for 5 of the 11 room categories were
drawn to represent the known concepts and 1000 unlabelled samples were drawn from
all the room categories for learning the unconditional probability distribution.
Using those samples, factors were learnt for the graphs used to model the
conditional distribution and the independent unconditional distribution.
\autoref{fig:simple-experiment} shows the graph structure used for approximate the
trained conditional and unconditional distributions.
Its important to notice that graph $G$ used to model the known classes perfectly
mimics the real distribution, with the exception that the system is not aware of
all the room categories.

\end{figure}

% Describe how to obtain the 3 thresholds functions seen on the graphs.
Using the learned models $G$, $U$ and $I$ two thresholds were trained:
$P_G(x)/P_U(x)$ assuming a uniform unconditional distribution
and $P_G(x)/P_I(x)$ assuming an independent unconditional distribution.
Since the distribution is synthetic there is access to $P(x)$ and $P(x|concept)$
and so a perfect threshold function could also be created to test how far the
presented thresholds are from optimal.

\subsection{Suitable functions for implementing a Static Threshold}
%%% Results 1
% Show the threshold ratio is an optimal detector (if perfect information was available)
% Show that the thresholds are suitable functions for implementing a static threshold.
As first tryout, the performance of the novelty thresholds was plotted for a set
of 1000 samples taken out from the whole distribution (\autoref{fig:synthetic-roc}).
Those samples contain different number of sensed properties for each room, miming
the dynamic properties expected to see when implemented on a robot.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{results/synthetic-all.pdf}

\caption{\label{fig:synthetic-roc}ROC curve comparing novelty detection performance
         under samples with variable size of sensed properties.}
\end{figure}

The convex shape of the optimal threshold shows that the ratio between conditional
and unconditional probability is indeed an optimal detector and is suitable for
implementing a static threshold when the samples are taken from dynamic
distributions (eg.: some samples where there is only access to room size versus
samples where there is a lot of information on the room properties).

% Discuss importance on approximating unconditional probability.
Its also possible to see how important it is to estimating a correct unconditional
probability in order to obtain a correct novelty ordering on the inputs.
The assumption of an uniform unconditional probability has led to very poor results.
That is probably explained by semantic properties as the ones modelled to be highly
biased towards some values and understanding that bias plays an important step
to detect whether a given sensed value is a valuable clue on the room category
or not.



%%% Results 2
% Measure performance of the thresholds as more information becomes available.
\subsection{Performance impact as more information becomes available}
In order to measure the performance impact as more semantic information becomes
available ROC curves were plotted for samples grouped by the number of sensed
semantic properties.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\subfloat[3 sensed features]{\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{results/synthetic-3features.pdf}}

\caption{\label{fig:synthetic-roc-breakdown}ROC curves plotted showing performance of the
         presented novelty detection method on graphs generated for different amount of
         sensed features.}
\end{figure}

As possible to see as the system gains more semantic information it becomes easier
to detect novelty as the input space size increases and allows the several existing
classes to become more easily distinguished.

The performance of the independent threshold decreases as the number of sensed
features increases. This is easily explained by the fact that the graph $I$ is not
able to model the existent dependence between the features and that becomes obvious
as the number of features increases (Eg.: graph $I$ perfectly models $P(x)$ in the
case where only 1 feature is sensed).

The uniform threshold shows a very poor performance specially on small size samples
where its performs almost no better than random.
It performance increases as the size of sensed features increases but nonetheless
its always very small when compared to how optimal a threshold could be.
This shows that at least under semantic distributions as the one modelled with the
synthetic data assuming an uniform unconditional distribution is a very bad choice.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
On this paper it was presented how to define a stable novelty threshold function on
top of \emph{probabilistic graphical models} instantiated dynamically from sensed
semantic data.
The presented technique is based on the ratio between a conditional and
unconditional probability and when perfect information exists it performs an optimal
novelty detection threshold.

It was also shown that a correct estimation of unconditional probability plays an
important role specially on small input spaces. And that semi-supervised techniques
implemented with the access to unlabelled data can be used to significantly improve
novelty detection performance.

On the used synthetic distribution, an assumption on an uniform
distribution has led to very poor results. This same behaviour is expected to held
in real world distributions also based on semantic data. And for that reason
and due to easy access to unlabelled data special attention will be given on using
semi-supervised techniques for novelty detection.

After this initial study on how to detect new semantic classes based on
\emph{graphical models} future work will focus on how to use the structured
information available from the conceptual layer and be able to detect which variable
of the graph is novel and what makes it different from other previously learned
classes. That will lead to generation of useful information that can be used on
communication with the user and perform active learning of new room categories.
