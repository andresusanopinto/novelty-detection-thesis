\begin{abstract}
This papers presents an approach on implementing novelty detection at semantic level
for indoor room classification in Dora. \emph{Graphical models} are used to model
probabilistic knowledge and novelty detection is implemented on top of them.
The novelty threshold is then optimized using an unconditional probability density
model that is trained from unlabelled data.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain context of indoor room categorization and importance of novelty detection.
\item Introduce Dora and explain how it would benefit or use the semantic novel detection.
\end{itemize}

There has been several efforts in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in creating robots
that are able to interact with humans and their environments.
One of the existing problems is a reliable high-level localization method that can be deployed into new
and unknown environments.
In this article we focus on the mapping, using \emph{semantic data}, of indoor environments such as houses and offices to room categories
such as kitchen, corridor, office.
And how to perform novelty detection on them: \emph{detect a new room category that was not present in the labelled data}.

Dora\cite{dora} (CogX: Dora) was used as a base system where this novelty detection would be implemented.
As Dora moves through the environment its \emph{conceptual layer} builds a structural and probabilistic representation of the space
instantiated as a \emph{graphical model}.
That model connects the sensed properties together with the variables used to model the world.
And allows to perform queries on the probabilities of aspects of the environment.
For example: where is most likely to find a cereal box\cite{exploiting}.

The ability to recognize novel categories on the modelled variables would allow to increase
reliability and allow the creation of self-extending behaviours.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Related Work}
\cite{quattoni2009recognizing} showed that most scene recognition models work poorly in indoor
scenes when compared to outdoor scenes results.
Since the properties that characterize rooms changes conforming its category. Namely corridors are
well described by global properties and bookstores are well described by the presence of specific objects (books).
Their work shows a multi-modal approach is expected to yield better performance by mixing several sources of information.

\cite{galindo2005multi} defines a bidirectional relation between object and room category, where object defines a room category and a room category provides information on where objects may be found.

Probabilistic representations are used in several localised functions in robots operating in the real-world~\cite{gross2009toomas,maierprobabilistic}. And some employ, up to some extent, a probabilistic representation across some subsystems~\cite{kraft2008exploration}.
\cite{vasudevan2008bayesian} performed room categorization through Bayesian reasoning about the presence of objects but did not included observations models (perception is considered deterministic).
And \cite{boutell2006factor} have studied outdoor scene classification using \emph{factor graphs} and modelling spatial relations between objects in the scene to extract better knowledge from semantic (high-level) features.

Its expected that using a unified probabilistic model from the whole system, such as \cite{pronobis2011exploiting}, more information can be reused to correctly predict a given random variable.

Although this paper deals with novelty detection on the robotics area, it does so using very
standard concepts and techniques such as semantic data and graphical models.
Those are often found on areas related with information retrieval.
Interesting examples are works in automatic image annotation using an hidden concept layer between visual features and text information\cite{zhang2005probabilistic}.

\section{Dora Architecture Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce Dora architecture aspects important for the paper
\item Explain what we mean by semantic data and how its captured by Dora
\item Introduce graphical models and how we use them (including notation on the paper)
\end{itemize}

From its architecture only the \emph{conceptual layer} is of interest to this article.
Its role is to aggregate the following semantic information coming from other layers:

\begin{description}
 \item[Doorway detection] is used to segment the low-level space into rooms and map connectivity between them.
 \item[Room size and shape] are classified by using 2D laser scans data and are associated as properties of a given room. The system utilizes pre-trained set of classifiers to label size as (large, medium, small) and shape as (rectangular or elongated).
 \item[Object detection] is performed using the visual input in order to detect . The system keeps track of the number of object and types seen per each room. Objects are once again detected by running a pre-trained set of detectors for: book, cereal box, computer, robot, stapler, toilet paper.
 \item[Room appearance] is categorized from the visual input by using CRFH and a pre-trained set of 7 different models.
\end{description}

With the extracted information and conceptual knowledge the conceptual layer creates a structured probabilistic representation
in order to model all known variables and their relations.
As so, in order to represent the knowledge the layer builds a \emph{chain graph}:
a probabilistic graphical model that merges both Bayesian Networks and Random Markov Fields.

The use of graphical models to describe distributions of variables has useful properties.
The edges between the variables can be seen as a kind of filter to the properties of the system.
Properties those that we expect to capture by the conceptual knowledge.
At the same time they are a generative models and therefore allow to calculate the probability
on any given subset of variables on the graph allowing the system to work even when some information is missing.

         create a structured probabilistic representation of the world.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Factor Graphs}
Although the conceptual layer works with \emph{chain graph}, those can be converted into \emph{factor graphs}.
We opted to use those as describing the ideas on this paper as they tend to be easier to understand.

A \emph{factor graph} is a bipartite graph connecting nodes representing random variables and factors.
Each factor represents a function dependent only on the variables to where its connected.
As so given factor graph $G$ can be seen as description of a distribution function over a set of variables obtained by
the product of all the factors. This manipulation allows to use algorithms such as the Sum-Product to efficiently calculate
probabilities on any given subset $x$ of those variables by exploiting conditional independency between variables.
We will use the notation $P_G(x)$ to represent that.

\section{Novelty Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define novelty detection 
\item Explain approach with a threshold function
\item Need of a normalizing factor for a threshold with dynamic functions
\item Usage of conditional density
\item Assuming of every output is equally likely
\item Using unlabelled data
\item What happens if the conditional and unconditional graphs differ only by the addition of a node?
\item How to implement that in the case a graph is a tree
\item Novelty detection on any variable of the graphical model!
\end{itemize}

% Introduce novelty detection
Novelty detection is an harder problem than that of classification due to its single-class nature.
Essentially a system is given training data and when given new data has to decide if it belongs
to the same concept it was trained with.

% Explain threshold approach to novelty detection
Due to the desired of robustness and generalization, a novelty detection system would always possess
some threshold that describes on how strict the system should be to new data.
This threshold is often seen as a distance measure to a normal input and several novelty detection
techniques are based on it.

When dealing with a statistic point of view, noisy data or unstable features, a decision on a given input has
an associated error rate. And in this case a novelty detection system is interested in defining an order
on all the possible inputs equivalent to the order imposed by the error rate: $P(novel|x)$.

Using bayes rule on the reversed order $P(\overline{novel}|x)$ and assuming a constant $P(\overline{novel})$
we obtain a ratio between a conditional and unconditional probabilites on the input $x$.
Such a ratio is a suitable function for implementing an optimal novelty detector system with
thresholding.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:novelty-threshold}
P(\overline{novel}|x) = \frac{P(x|\overline{novel}) P(\overline{novel})}{P(x)} = k\frac{P(x|\overline{novel})}{P(x)}
\end{equation}

% Explain approach of using conditional probability
\subsection{Conditional Probability: $P(x|\overline{novel})$}
\label{sec:uniform-unconditional}

One of the hardest problems is that on most cases a novelty detection system only have access to 
the known data.
Under that the best approach is to define a threshold based on $P(x|\overline{novel})/P(x)$
considering that $P(x)$ is constant through all the input space.

In the presented case the conditional probability is approximated by the graphical model $G$
produced by the conceptual layer.
The \autoref{fig:conditional-prob-graph} represents a possible graph $G$ built from the conceptual
layer to represent the conditional probability on the sensed variables $x$.
$P_G(x)$ is then used as an approximation for $P(x|\overline{novel})$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/conditional-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:conditional-prob-graph}The conceptual layer models the conditional
         probability distribution of the sensed variables by using hidden variables.
         Those are created from the conceptual knowledge and represent the structural
         and connectivity information the system is aware of.
         In this case only hidden variables $R_i$ were used to model the room categories
         where each property was sensed.}
\end{figure}


Its important to notice that in several cases assuming the unconditional probability $P(x)$ is constant leads to discarding the factor.
Nonetheless, here the distributions are dynamically changing as the system learns more on the environment.
So we need to keep the normalizing argument $P(x)$ and re-calculate it for each new subset of $x$.

Assuming that the unconditional distributions generates all possible outcome with the same probability
we can model it with $\prod{1/|x_i|}$, where $|x_i|$ denotes the state space size of variable $x_i$.
In graphical model terms, this would be equivalent to build a factor graph $U$ with the same variables but
without any factors as illustrated on \autoref{fig:uniform-prob-graph}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/uniform-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:uniform-prob-graph}Without any existing factors, this graph $U$ represents a uniform
         distribution over the set $x$.}
\end{figure}

Having now a graphical model built to model the known data distribution and assuming that in the unconditional case all
possible outcomes are equally likely a novelty threshold would be given by: $P_G(x)/P_{U}(x)$.

Here $P_{U}(x)$ can be seen as a normalizing factor to lever all the $P_G(x)$ on any set of variables $x$ into the same
measure units, such that a static threshold can be implemented.
For example in very large sets of variables $x$, a large dimension space, the conditional probability would spread over
the tails of the functions and would always yield very small values.
As so a novelty measure is seen as a ratio on how much introducing the known concepts helps to understand the observed result.


\subsection{Using Unlabelled Data}
Nonetheless its often the case that there is access to large amounts of unlabelled data.
Under that it becomes possible to obtain a better approach to the unconditional probability distribution than
the uniform one assumed in \autoref{sec:uniform-unconditional}.

For interesting and practical reasons it was assumed that the unconditional distribution
could be modelled with all the variables independent from each other.
Which translates as $P(x)=\prod{P_{x_i}(x_i)}$.
And so from the unlabelled data we only need to estimate $P_{x_i}$.
\autoref{fig:semisupervised-threshold} illustrates a graph $I$ to model independent variables.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/independent-prob-graph.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:semisupervised-threshold}Using unlabelled data, its possible to estimate
         the unconditional probability for each variable and this way try to compensate
         for a possible existent bias on some of the variables.}
\end{figure}

Once again the novelty threshold would be given by $P_G(x)/P_I(x)$.
This time the addition of the variables unconditional factors can be understood as an attempt to compensate
for an existing bias on the unconditional distribution.
Which is an important step to achieve a correct ordering of the input space for novelty thresholding.
This way our unconditional function perceives which features are slightly more biased to a certain value
and will compensate on the novelty calculation.

\subsection{Generalizing to Novelty Detection on a variable}
Until now, the presented methods describe how to detect data that belongs to a new class of input by creating
generative models for both conditional and unconditional probabilities distributions.

And although it serves as a method for detecting new classes in the input, it gives us no control in what
is novel in the input.
Recall that the graph $G$ used by Dora gives us a lot of semantic and conceptual information that we are
interested in analizying and improving with time. Being able to measure if the novel case derives from
a novel room category or from any other variables would be highly desirable on the system.

Lets assume that the only difference between the conditional and unconditional graph is a single node and its connecting factors
as seen on \autoref{fig:measure-room-novelty}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\subfloat[Conditional probability distribution $G$]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/simple-conditional-prob-graph.pdf}}
\hfill
\subfloat[Unconditional probability distribution $G'$]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/simple-unconditional-prob-graph.pdf}}

\caption{\label{fig:measure-room-novelty}In this case the only difference between $G$ and $G'$ is the room category variable
         and the associated factors that only exists in the former.}
\end{figure}

The notation $N_v$ is now used to refer to the measure $P_G(x)/P_{G'}(x)$, when $G$ and $G'$ differ only in the variable node $v$ and
its associated factor nodes.
And use it as a novelty measure of the variable $v$, as it attempts to measure on how much adding the variable $v$ helps to explain the
given distribution of values.

By assuming the graph is a tree and blabla, and expanding the calculation of $P_G(x)/P_{G'}(x)$ with the sum-product technique, leads to:

\begin{equation}
N_v(x) = \frac{\sum_{s \in States(v)}x / normalizing_{factor1}}{\prod{...} / normalizing_{factor2}}
\end{equation}

blablablaaa....
I haven't done the math here yet.... but it should give us a method for measuring on how much each variable is contributing to the novelty
threshold.
Also due to the nature of the graphical models it should be possible to calculate in $O(N)$ time for all the $N$ variables.
After the whole variables can be sorted by the contributions and presented to the user explaining where the novelty comes from.

Quotting Andrzej: """ Being able to automatically explain why a class is novel and what
makes it different from any of the other classes -- This is super important for communication with the user and active learning of new room categories."""

\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show results and how much it improves by using a simple method for unconditional probability
\end{itemize}

In order to verify the improvements obtained by using unlabelled data, a fictitious simple dataset was generated.
The fictitious distribution assumes that an independent and variable size set of features $x$ is generated by a
given room category category. In whole there was 11 different room categories and 7 different measured properties types.

The known data was extracted by generating samples from 6 of the 11 classes. Together with the generated known data, the
room category that generated is given as label. Using that we built the factors for the generation of graphs representing
the conditional distribution $G$.
Using unlabelled data we trained also a graph $I$ representing an unconditional distribution where all features are independent.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{figures/roc-simple.pdf}

This graph is from a previous experience. Where there was even no need for the normalizing factor.

\caption{\label{fig:fictitious-roc}ROC curve comparing novelty detection performance between an optimal detector,
         $P_G(x)/P_U(x)$ a graph ratio considering an uniform unconditional distribution and
         $P_G(x)/P_I(x)$ a graph ratio considering an independent unconditional distribution}
\end{figure}

Since the distribution is fictitious we were able to create an optimal novelty detector, as we can exactly measure $P(novel|x)$.
That served as a comparison on how optimal a detector could be.
A ROC curve was plotted for the three methods on \autoref{fig:fictitious-roc}.
As possible to see a correct estimation on the unconditional probability is important for obtaining a correct ordering of the
input space.
