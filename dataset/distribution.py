'''This is a very small python module to define distributions over python data.
Those definitions can then be used to draw samples from them.

Example.:
dA = DiscreteDistribution( [ (10, 'A'), (30, 'B'), (20, ('C')) ] )
GenerateSample(dA) is expected to return:
  10/60 'A's, 30/60 'B's, 20/60 'C's

dB = DiscreteDistribution( [ (10, "hello"), (40, "bye")] )
dist = [dA, dB]
GenerateSample(dist) will return [a, b] where a and b have been draw from dA, dB.
