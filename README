About This Repository
=====================

This repository will be used to share the documentation and work developed during my
thesis.

Having in mind the objective that all developed work of mine is reproducible, all
the produced documentation, code and results used for my thesis and my continuous
research on the topic are contained on this repository.

At the moment the build system is based on "scons" [1]. By running it, you can
expected the same documents that were delivered to be reproduced on your machine.

A list of contents on this repository follows and inside each of the repositories
you can find a README file with extra details where applicable.
